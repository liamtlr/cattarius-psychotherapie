    <p>
      Having lived in the UK for many years, I also offer psychotherapy in English.
    </p>
    <h2>My understanding of psychotherapy</h2>
    <p>
      As a psychodynamic psychotherapist, it is very important for me to build
      a trusting relationship with my patients. I create a safe atmosphere in
      which you can open up and share your innermost thoughts and feelings.
      I believe that a positive therapeutic relationship is essential for
      successful therapy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not see my patients as symptom carriers, but as individuals with
      unique life stories and deep conflicts that are often hidden in the
      unconscious. I place particular emphasis on the emotional aspects, as I
      am convinced that our emotions are closely connected to our thoughts and
      actions. I help my clients to understand and accept their emotions so
      that they can resolve their inner conflicts and overcome mental blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      My invitation to you is to come as yourself, with no preconceived notions
      or criticisms, and together we can work towards understanding the
      situation and identifying the root of any difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ich lade Sie dazu ein, so zu erscheinen, wie Sie sind. Gemeinsam k√∂nnen
      wir dann erarbeiten und verstehen, was in Ihnen vor sich geht und welchen
      Ursprung ihre Probleme haben.
    </p>
    <h2>Formalities</h2>
    <p>
      Before starting psychotherapy with me, it is important that we get to
      know each other in an initial session. Following this meeting, additional
      sessions, referred to as probatory sessions, will take place. These serve
      several purposes, such as determining if psychotherapy is suitable for
      you and providing you with the opportunity to establish a trusting
      therapeutic relationship with me.
    </p>
    <h2>For Private Health Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      Usually, the first session and the following five sessions (also known as
      trial sessions) will be covered by your insurance. If you have a mental
      health diagnosis, health insurance typically covers the cost of
      psychotherapy. It is important that you check with your private health
      insurance at the beginning of therapy to see if and to what extent
      psychotherapy is covered.
    </p>
    <h2>For Public Health Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, I am not able to directly bill public health insurance in
      my private practice. However, I am happy to discuss with you whether we
      can conduct treatment through the reimbursement procedure. To receive
      coverage in my practice, you must prove that you have been unable to
      obtain an available treatment slot with a licensed practitioner. Please
      contact your health insurance to find out if and how reimbursement is
      possible.
    </p>
    <h2>For Self-Paying Patients</h2>
    <p>
      It is, of course, also possible to pay for psychotherapy yourself. There
      may be various reasons for doing so. The fees for treatment are based on
      the GOP.

      may have regarding formalities.
